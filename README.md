# kvizz-bot

Kvizz-bot is one way of playing [the online quiz-game of Ol√≠s](https://kvizz.olis.is) automatically. The bot guesses random options and saves them for later use. After learning all the answers, each instance of the bot can play ca. 150 games per hour. 

The bot can score unlimited coupons for overpriced candy bars, but please don't - it's probably immoral!

~~July 15th 2021 - The bot does not work as the quiz prevents the email format used.~~

July 21st 2021 - It's working again!
